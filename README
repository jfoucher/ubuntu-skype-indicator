This indicator plugin allows you to view your skype missed chats and missed calls in your system wide messaging indicator

Installation:
Copy the script to a folder on your computer. Double click on it to open. If asked whether to display, run in terminal, or run, choose "Run"

A new skype submenu should appear in the messaging indicator.
When you receive a new skype message, an unread message notification will appear in that submenu.
Clicking on it opens that conversation in skype.
Clicking the main skype submenu open Skype's main window.

TODO :
- debian package
- Manage missed calls as well
- Remove skype icon from notification area ? is that even possible ?
